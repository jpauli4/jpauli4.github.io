<h1>Assignments</h1>

<h2>This course has taught me much about the practices of coding. Furthermore, I have learned that thinking about the use of code can help you think differently about research possibilities. Even when you are not able to write your own lines of html, css or javascript, knowing about the advantages of those languages encourages you to think ahead about new directions in your research.</h2>

<p>While taking this course, I was also enrolled in a tutorial on the topic of multimodality. Multimodality is the creation of meaning by different modes in the creation of meaning. Instead of examining the function of audio, visual or textual in communication, a multimodal approach addresses multiple modes at the same time (Jewitt, 14). For this course, I wrote a paper on mobile phone application Instagram, in which I examined the relationship between the photos people publish and the hashtags they use. I looked at the role of framing, narrative and community in the light of the production of identities through hashtag and photos with the aim to provide an overarching framework of how people express themselves on Instagram. To combine these broad range of elements, I included a case study where I collected and processed data to visualize all aspects of what I was researching. There, I encountered two problems:</p>

<h2><ul>
	<li>There are usually more hashtags than photos in a data collection, as photos contained an average of 20 hashtags. This means the data collection was relatively big. In order to be able to gather data manually, I needed to make compromises on my collection. In practice, this meant I could only look at a limited amount of photos
	</li>
	<li>While my aim was to research the textual mode (hashtag) and visual mode (photo) at the same time, I noticed that common research programs such as Excel do not provide tools to visualize data from both modes at the same time. Placing them into a visualization together would make it impossible to scan the information directly, which should be the purpose of a data visualization. 
	</li>
	</ul>
</h2> 

<p>In other words, I was lacking a tool to collected a large corpus of data, as well as a tool that is able to visualize different data structures at the same time.
Therefore, I  wish to design a tool that is able to fulfil the gap in multimodal research tools. The main goal of this tool should be visualization. Interpretation of data is less important, as this can be done through programs such as SPSS. The main advantage of this tool is that it allows you to browse your data visually  and see connections between different data structures.
How does it work?</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>Collect data through the Instagram API</li>
	<li>Store data online (for instance in Firebase)</li>
	<li>Explore your data through your own set of filters</li>
	<li>Visualise your data while searching</li>
</ol></p>

<p>What should it look like?</p>
