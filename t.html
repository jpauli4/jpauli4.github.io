<div class="researchinfo">

<p>As a humanities student, I consider myself to be more Alfa than Beta. I have a natural preference for learning languages and understanding societal issues. Media studies, with most of its roots in literature studies, fits perfectly within these preferences. Still, I believe it is odd that a field of study closely related to technological developments teaches their students nothing about the technique behind the media objects they study. </p>

<p>This ‘technological deficit’, as I would like to call it, flows from the system our universities use. Next to the different universities, studies are also divided into faculties consisting of a collection of related studies. While the faculty system is important for financial and practical reasons, it also seems to express value judgments on the nature of studies. As an example, the University of Amsterdam describes studies within the humanities faculty as “venerable” (University of Amsterdam, 2014). Does this mean studies in other faculties are not venerable? Probably not.</p>

<p>It shows a desire to distinguish oneself. While most scholars will acknowledge the importance of linkages between research fields, it is at the same time encouraged to stay within your own faculty. In my opinion, we need to get rid of any fears that keep us from learning from each other. Knowing I was an alpha student has impaired me from diving into beta-related topics.</p>
<p>In the light of this issue, I believe a course on coding within the humanities has the function of bridge building. It is very useful to teach students about the implications and practices of coding, as this helps students to think critically but also develop practical skills. There are in my opinion two great advantages. Firstly, the practical skills that students acquire helps them to create research tools which allow them to extend and improve their research. Understanding how computers work can encourage you to try out new software, to work faster and help you with comprehending data.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, in more advanced stages, coding skills allow you to design your own research tool. Not having the limitations of only working regular programs can open doors to new types of research. A research tool supports you in collecting, analysing and visualizing data. Especially within the humanities, where most research is still based on literature, new tools can extend and improve research. A second advantage of acquiring coding skills is the impact it can have on your way of thinking. The logic of programming helps you to think differently about existing paradigms.</p>
 <p> Many things in life are labelled by society. Institutes, laws, traditions often define the way we see ourselves. We are labelled as hetero, homosexual, black, white, female, male and many other things. They seem natural, but they are not. The name given to define a difference is always loaded with opinions. Many scholars have studied the problems of structures and categorization (e.g. Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway and many others), which has produced many books, articles and most of all knowledge.</p>
<p>Reading about coding and learning how to practice coding has taught me that you can make everything you want, as long as you know how to explain that to the computer. It is possible to create your own labels, own definitions and own structures. In theory, therefore, code has the ability to make changes that are difficult to make though institutions. Naturally, code cannot simply change society, but it does offer possibilities on a personal scale.  You start with a blank canvas and design things that you need or want. It makes you more independent.</p> 
<p>There are many sides of coding of which I underestimated the importance. Coding is more than learning to build apps or websites. It allows you to think beyond borders and obstacles. Therefore I argue coding deserves to be studied and practiced more often. Also by humanities students. In the end, the technological developments will make coding will increasingly important. I thus strongly hope courses as this one will help to overcome the technological deficit within the humanities.</p>
